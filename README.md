# Portfolio Project
In this *Portfolio Project* I will showcase my skills in the following:
1.	JavaScript
2.	SQL
3.	Power BI / DAX / M
4.	Python
5.	Machine Learning

## Power BI and SQL
* For Power BI / DAX / M and SQL I have taken tables that Snowflake has created and maintained, aggregated them using an SQL query, and then did further calculations and visualizations using Power BI. Using Power BI, I was able to show trends, totals, forecasting, and dynamic legends.

    You can find these documents in the *CDC Project* zip file.

* To use Power BI to solve a real, personal problem I created a dashboard to do visualizations on different cities to consider moving to. Using data from Niche.com about cities my family and I were thinking of moving to we were able to plot housing trends, safety and school ratings, and more.

    You can find this exercise in the *Home_Price* Power BI file.

## Python / Jupyter Notebook
* For Python, I have done correlation testing using a dataset that has information about movies and tv shows on Amazon Prime. I use this testing to showcase driving factors behind a tv show / movie’s popularity. 

    You can find these documents in the *Amazon Prime Video Correlation* file.

* To take it a step further, I created three machine learning models with actual business data from a previous role. I trained the ML models to predict client conversions and which clients needed a “pulse check” to drive retention. 

    You can find this exercise in the *Machine Learning Predictions* file.

## JavaScript

* As I begin my JavaScript learning journey I will post more JS files as my technical skills advance. You can find this progression in any file ending in .JS.
