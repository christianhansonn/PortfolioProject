# Portfolio Project
In this *Portfolio Project* I will showcase my skills in the following:

1. AWS Data Pipeline
2.	Python / Jupyter Notebook
3.	Power BI and SQL
4.	Node.js
5.	Portfolio Website

## AWS Data Pipeline
For ETL and data pipelining, my process includes:
- Storing a dataset in S3.
- Extracting and transforming it with custom Python code using AWS Glue.
- Loading the cleaned data into an Aurora database in RDS.
- Writing a query to use for Quicksight to visualize the cleaned dataset.

   * You can find this process and supporting files outlined in the [Data Pipeline](https://github.com/christianhansonn/PortfolioDataPipeline/tree/main) file.

## <a id="Python">Python / Jupyter Notebook</a>
* For Python, I have done correlation testing using a dataset that has information about movies and tv shows on Amazon Prime. I use this testing to showcase driving factors behind a tv show / movie’s popularity. 

    * You can find these documents in the [Amazon Prime Video Correlation](https://github.com/christianhansonn/PortfolioProject/blob/main/Amazon%20Prime%20Video%20Correlation.ipynb) file.

* As an additional side project, I wrote a web scraping tool that scrapes a job board for job postings, automates the job application, and does an analysis on pay range data.

  * You can find tese documents in the  [Automating Job Applications with BeautifulSoup and Playwright](https://github.com/christianhansonn/PortfolioWebScrape) repo.

* As part of a Machine Learning certification through Codecademy, I was asked to analyze, draw predictions, and showcase my findings for a test insurance data set.

   * You can find these documents in the [Insurance Portfolio Project](https://github.com/christianhansonn/PortfolioProject/blob/main/insurance_portfolio_project.ipynb) file.

* To take it a step further, I created three machine learning models with actual business data from a previous role. I trained the ML models to predict client conversions and which clients needed a “pulse check” to drive retention. 

    * You can find this exercise in the [Machine Learning Predictions](https://github.com/christianhansonn/PortfolioProject/blob/main/Machine%20Learning%20Predictions.ipynb) file.

## <a id="Power-BI">Power BI and SQL</a>
* For Power BI / DAX / M and SQL I have taken tables that Snowflake has created and maintained, aggregated them using an SQL query, and then did further calculations and visualizations using Power BI. Using Power BI, I was able to show trends, totals, forecasting, and dynamic legends.

    * You can find these documents in the [CDC Project](https://github.com/christianhansonn/PortfolioProject/blob/main/CDC%20Project.zip) zip file.

* To use Power BI to solve a real, personal problem I created a dashboard to do visualizations on different cities to consider moving to. Using data from Niche.com about cities my family and I were thinking of moving to we were able to plot housing trends, safety and school ratings, and more.

    * You can find this exercise in the [Home Price](https://github.com/christianhansonn/PortfolioProject/blob/main/Home_Price.pbix) Power BI file.

## <a id="JS">Node.js</a>

* For Node.js, I have created automated quality assurance / regression tests using Playwright.
   
   * You can find this document in the [Playwright Test Case Automation](https://github.com/christianhansonn/PortfolioProject/blob/main/playwrightTestLoop.spec.js) file.

## <a id="HTML">Portfolio Website</a>

* You can see my custom [Portfolio Website](https://christianhansonn.github.io/PortfolioWebsite/). 

* At the bottom of my website I have links to my LinkedIn and this repository.
