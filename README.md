# Portfolio Project
In this *Portfolio Project* I will showcase my skills in the following:
1.	Power BI and SQL
2.	Python / Jupyter Notebook
3.	JavaScript
4.	HTML and CSS

## <a id="Power-BI">Power BI and SQL</a>
* For Power BI / DAX / M and SQL I have taken tables that Snowflake has created and maintained, aggregated them using an SQL query, and then did further calculations and visualizations using Power BI. Using Power BI, I was able to show trends, totals, forecasting, and dynamic legends.

    * You can find these documents in the [CDC Project](https://github.com/christianhansonn/PortfolioProject/blob/main/CDC%20Project.zip) zip file.

* To use Power BI to solve a real, personal problem I created a dashboard to do visualizations on different cities to consider moving to. Using data from Niche.com about cities my family and I were thinking of moving to we were able to plot housing trends, safety and school ratings, and more.

    * You can find this exercise in the [Home_Price](https://github.com/christianhansonn/PortfolioProject/blob/main/Home_Price.pbix) Power BI file.

## <a id="Python">Python / Jupyter Notebook</a>
* For Python, I have done correlation testing using a dataset that has information about movies and tv shows on Amazon Prime. I use this testing to showcase driving factors behind a tv show / movie’s popularity. 

    * You can find these documents in the [Amazon Prime Video Correlation](https://github.com/christianhansonn/PortfolioProject/blob/main/Amazon%20Prime%20Video%20Correlation.ipynb) file.

* As part of a Machine Learning certification through Codecademy, I was asked to analyze, draw predictions, and showcase my findings for a test insurance data set.

   * You can find these documents in the [Insurance Portfolio Project](https://github.com/christianhansonn/PortfolioProject/blob/main/insurance_portfolio_project.ipynb) file.

* To take it a step further, I created three machine learning models with actual business data from a previous role. I trained the ML models to predict client conversions and which clients needed a “pulse check” to drive retention. 

    * You can find this exercise in the [Machine Learning Predictions](https://github.com/christianhansonn/PortfolioProject/blob/main/Machine%20Learning%20Predictions.ipynb) file.

## <a id="JS">JavaScript</a>

* As I begin my JavaScript learning journey through Codecademy, I will post more JS files as my technical skills advance. You can find my progression in any file ending in .JS.

Some files to check out:
1. [messageGenerator](https://github.com/christianhansonn/PortfolioProject/blob/main/messageGenerator.js) (My first JS portfolio project)
2. [Team Roster](https://github.com/christianhansonn/PortfolioProject/blob/main/Team%20Roster.js) (A practice demo for JS syntax)

## <a id="HTML">HTML and CSS</a>

* Similarly to my progression in JavaScript, I am also learning HTML and CSS through Codecademy. You can see my skills thus far in my [personal portfolio website](https://christianhansonn.github.io/PortfolioWebsite/). 

* At the bottom of my website I have links to my LinkedIn, personal email, this repository, and resume.
