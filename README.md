# PortfolioProject
In this Portfolio Project, I start to showcase my different levels of expertise in both DAX, SQL, Python and Power BI. 

For SQL, Power BI and DAX, I take tables that Snowflake has already created and committed to updating, aggregate them to pull particular information relevant to what I'm wanting to report on, and then build visuals in a Power BI report. In this report I visualize the data to show totals, trends, and forecast into the future.  In the Power BI report you will see that I do some basic DAX functions to create my own date and calculated measures table. I also implement advanced features like dynamic legends, column formatting, and forecasting.

You can also see my custom SQL by opening the "CDC Portfolio Project SQL" text file.

For my Python project, I take a dataset that shows information about movies and tv shows in Amazon Prime's digital catalog. From there, I try to draw conclusions about driving factors for different columns by calculating correlations. I find that the shows and movies popularity is directly correlated on the number of votes it gets.

You can see this information in the "Amazon Prime Video Correlation" file.
