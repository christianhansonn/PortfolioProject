# PortfolioProject
In this Portfolio Project, I take tables that Snowflake has already created and committed to updating,
aggregate them to pull particular information relevant to what I'm wanting to report on,
and then build visuals in a Power BI report to show totals, trends, and forecast into the future.

This portfolio project is intenteded to show my intermediate skills of SQL coding and using the
data visulization tool Power BI. In the Power BI report you will see that I do some basic DAX functions
to create my own date and calculated measures table. I also implement advanced features like dynamic legends,
column formatting, and forecasting.

I have included the original table views, indicated by "_ORIGINAL", as well as the final table products, indicated by "CQ_".
You can also see my custom SQL by opening the "CDC Portfolio Project SQL" text file.
